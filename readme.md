# Counters App

A simple python app which gives counters picks to heroes. Data scraped from [DotaBuff](https://https://www.dotabuff.com/) website using [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) libraries. I used [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for GUI. Thanks to [Flaticon](https://flaticon.com/free-icon/dota-2_871499) for the awesome icon.
